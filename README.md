# C-Programming-A-Modern-Approach-2nd-Ed-by-K.N.-King---Programming-Projects
Solutions to the Programming Projects found in "C Programming A Modern Approach 2nd Ed" by K.N. King


In this repository I plan to commit all solutions to the Programming Projects sections found at the end of each chapter of K.N. King's work "C Programming A Modern Approach 2nd Eddition".

Please note that these may not be the best solutions to the given problems, i do not claim they are. 

This shall be looked as more of an exercise than anything, as I will be solving the problems as I am going through the book and getting myself familiar with the C programming language.
